        <p class="journal-text"><strong>Title page</strong><br>The title page should be paginated as page 1 of the manuscript. Title of article: Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible. </p> <p class="journal-text">Author names and affiliations: The title page should include the names and addresses of authors. Generally for uniformity author names should be written as the first name, middle name initial followed by family name, e.g. James Z. Miller. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name. </p><p class="journal-text">Corresponding author: Clearly indicate who is willing to handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. Ensure that telephone numbers (with country and area code) are provided in addition to the e-mail address and the complete postal address. </p><p class="journal-text">Present/permanent address: If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a 'Present address' (or 'Permanent address') may be indicated as a footnote to that author's name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes.</p>
        <p class="journal-text"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>The abstract will be printed at the beginning of the paper. A concise and factual abstract is required (maximum length 350 words). The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results, and major conclusions. Do not cite references in the abstract. Non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided in the abstract, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself. The abstract must be organized under the following subject headings: Background: This must indicate why the study was performed, and what question it was intended to answer. Methods: This should state in outline what methods were used. Results: The main results relevant to the question addressed should be summarized. Conclusions: This should summarize the main inferences that follow from the results. Keywords, Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords. Be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. Define abbreviations that are not standard in this field at their first occurrence in the article: in the abstract but also in the main text after it.</p>
        <p class="journal-text"><strong>Introduction</strong><br>The introduction should give a short and clear account of the background of the problem and state the objectives of the work. Only previous work that has a direct bearing on the present problem should be cited. </p>
        <p class="journal-text"><strong>Methods</strong><br>The methods must be described in sufficient detail to allow the experiments to be interpreted and repeated by an experienced investigator. Where published methods are used, references should be given, together with a brief outline. The statistical tool used to analyze the data should be mentioned. The description of drugs, chemicals, and other materials should include the names and brief addresses of the relevant suppliers. Drug names should be International Non-proprietary Names (INN). If a drug has no INN its full chemical name must be used. All procedures involving experimental animals or human subjects must accompany a statement on ethical approval from the appropriate ethics committee. </p>
        <p class="journal-text"><strong>Results</strong><br>Present your results in a logical sequence in the text, tables, and figures, giving the main or most important findings first. Do not repeat in the text all the data in the tables or figures; emphasize or summarize only important observations.</p>
        <p class="journal-text"><strong>Discussion and Conclusions</strong><br>The purpose of the discussion is to present a brief and pertinent interpretation of the results against the background of existing knowledge. Any assumptions on which conclusions are based must be stated clearly. The main conclusions should be conveyed in a final paragraph with a clear statement of how the study advances knowledge and understanding in the field. </p>
        <p class="journal-text"><strong>Acknowledgments</strong><br>Collate acknowledgments in a separate section at the end of the article and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. When the work included in a paper has been supported by a grant from any source, this must be indicated. A connection of any author with companies producing any substances or apparatus used in the work should be declared. All contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship as defined above should be listed in an acknowledgments section. Examples of those who might be acknowledged include a person who provided purely technical help, writing assistance, or a department chair that provided only general support. Authors should disclose whether they had any writing assistance and identify the entity that paid for this assistance. </p>
        <p class="journal-text"><strong>Declarations</strong><br>This information must also be inserted into your manuscript under the acknowledgments section with the headings below. If you have no declaration to make please insert the following statements into your manuscript: </p><p class="journal-text">Funding: None</p><p class="journal-text">Conflict of interest: None declared</p><p class="journal-text">Ethical approval: Required. </p>
        <p class="journal-text"><strong>Citation and References</strong><br>It is the author's responsibility to check all references very carefully for accuracy and completeness. In the text, references are cited by surname (s) of the author(s) and year of publication parenthetically at the appropriate place. When a source has two authors, list both followed by a year of publication e.g. (Muhammad and David, 2018); for three or more authors list only the first author's name followed by “et al.” and year of publication e.g. (Chowdhury et al.  2002). In the reference section, list the references in alphabetical order. For each reference, all authors' names should be included. Examples of correct forms of references are given below: </p>
